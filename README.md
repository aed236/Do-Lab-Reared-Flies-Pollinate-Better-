Original raw data for the research article, "Do laboratory-reared flies make better pollinators? Morphology, behaviour, and pollination performance of Eristalis tenax (Syrphidae)"

Paper abstract: Flies (Diptera) are important pollinators in global agriculture, yet little is known about how intraspecific trait variation influences their pollination performance. We compared morphological traits, foraging behaviour, and pollination performance between laboratory-reared and wild populations of Eristalis tenax (Diptera: Syrphidae) in hybrid seed carrot (Daucus carota) under semi-controlled conditions (in-field cages) in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. Laboratory-reared flies were significantly larger than wild flies in body length, intertegular distance, and thorax width. Single-visit pollination assays showed that both fly populations deposited more pollen than unvisited control flowers, but laboratory-reared flies pollinated more stigmas per visit. Seed set trials revealed that umbels pollinated by laboratory-reared E. tenax produced significantly more seeds than those pollinated by wild flies or unvisited controls, although seed weight did not differ between fly populations. Foraging activity differed between populations: lab-reared flies were more active on male umbels, in early morning hours (05:00 – 08:00), and within moderate temperature (20–30°C) and humidity (33–66%) ranges compared to wild E. tenax. Wild flies exhibited more consistent foraging activity, visiting both male and female umbels in similar numbers across the full survey period (05:00–17:00) and a broader humidity range (0–99% RH), suggesting greater temporal and environmental adaptability. These findings suggest that laboratory-reared E. tenax, despite artificial rearing, can deliver equal or greater pollination services than wild populations, with implications for their targeted deployment in managed agroecosystems. Future efforts to optimise fly-based pollination services should consider trade-offs between fly size and production scale, and the environmental contexts in which managed flies are deployed. <img width="468" height="593" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f9f394-34d2-45f6-9c32-6e83878067ae" />
